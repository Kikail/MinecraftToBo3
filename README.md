## 🧩 What is this?

**Block2Prefab** is a Java tool that transforms Minecraft schematic files—such as `.litematic`, `.schem`, and `.schematic`—into prefabs compatible with the **Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Mod Tools**.

This allows you to bring your Minecraft structures directly into your custom BO3 zombie or multiplayer maps using Radiant.

- 💡 Easily extensible by the user

## 🔁 Block Mapping System (Customizable)

Block2Prefab uses a **user-editable `.txt` file** to map Minecraft block IDs to Call of Duty: BO3 asset equivalents. This allows precise control over how each block should be interpreted in Radiant.

### 📝 Mapping Format

If a block is missing to your world it will appear as stone block, if it happens you can add a new line in the txt file.
Each line of the file must follow one of these formats:

- material    minecraft:<block_id>,<bo3_material_name>
- prefab      minecraft:<block_id>,<path_to_bo3_prefab.map>
- model       minecraft:<block_id>,"_model_"+<bo3_model_name>
